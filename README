DEPENDENCIES:
eyeD3
apt-get install eyeD3


install:
place the mtag folder where ever you want and create a symlink from mtag.py to somewhere in your path (ex: /usr/bin/mtag) 

mtag -h for usage


This is basically a custom wrapper for eyeD3 All major tag related (set/get tag info, convert to v2.3) functionality is due to eyeD3 and I take no credit for it.
